# Level 350 - Week 3 - Final checks

Make sure to verify that all of the features work and they are deployed to the internet.

To confirm the minimum set of features you need to show are the following:

- Page is showing a list of video recommendations
- Each recommendation has an embedded Youtube video that can be played from the website
- There is a section where you can add new videos to the website
  - Videos without titles or invalid Youtube URLs are not allowed by the API
- Each video has a delete button, pressing it will delete the video from the website
- Each video has a "vote up" and a "vote down" button, pressing them increases or decreases the rating of the video
- All changes done on the frontend are saved to the database

If you have confirmed all of the features above are working then congratulations! You have deployed this Full Stack Project to the internet! Make sure to ask a tech-ed volunteer to go through your implementation and verify that it works as expected. Once they do that, you will be approved to join the graduation project!

If you have time you should still check any optional levels that you have missed so far. If you wish this to be one of your portfolio piece we strongly recommend checking [level 399](./399.md) first. Afterwards if you still have some time you can find some additional ideas at [level 499](./499.md) that we recommend you taking a look at!
