# Video Recommendation App

## Background

Before you continue to final projects we have to make sure that you can meaningfully contribute to a technical project.

This means that we need to be sure that you can create and deploy Full Stack application.

## Challenge

In this project you will be building up a small project that allows you to share your favourite Youtube videos with the world. We will be starting up with a very small MVP (Minimal Viable Product), and built on top of it to make it nicer and more useful.

## Levels

The project requirements are split into several levels that you should complete during each week of this project.

You can find each of the levels split into separate files, linked below.

**Note:** Some of the levels are optional which means that you can build a working project without them. However, to make something really impressive you will need to complete as much as you can.

### Week 1 - Minimal Viable Product

- [Level 100](./requirements/100.md)
  - Defining requirements
- [Level 105](./requirements/105.md)
  - Setting up the project
- [Level 110](./requirements/110.md)
  - Building up the data model
- [Level 120](./requirements/120.md)
  - Implementing the API
- [Level 130](./requirements/130.md)
  - Implementing the frontend
- [Level 150](./requirements/150.md)
  - Checking MVP adheres to the acceptance criteria
- [Level 199](./requirements/199.md) (Optional)
  - Implementing code quality improvements

### Week 2 - Additional features

- [Level 200](./requirements/200.md)
  - UX Improvements
- [Level 210](./requirements/210.md)
  - Support for adding videos
- [Level 220](./requirements/220.md)
  - Support for the removal of videos
- [Level 299](./requirements/299.md) (Optional)
  - Implementing optional new features

### Week 3 - Finalizing project

- [Level 300](./requirements/300.md)
  - Allowing rating of videos
- [Level 350](./requirements/350.md)
  - Submitting solution for evaluation
- [Level 399](./requirements/399.md) (Optional)
  - Making project viable as a portfolio piece

### Week 4 - Stretch goals

- Use this week as an extra time to implement missing required and optional features from previous weeks.
- [Level 499](./requirements/499.md) (Optional)
  - Additional stretch goals to make your project really stand out

## Getting Started

Fork this repository and then clone it to your computer.

Progress to [Level 100](./requirements/100.md) when you are ready.

## Sample Solution

Here is an example solution for both frontend and backend, including all optional features:

**Note:** You can design the website to look however you like.

## Using this project for the launch project and other portfolio pieces

While you are free to use this codebase for your future projects we recommend against it. This project is set up in a way to make it easy to understand, but lacks a lot of features that would be otherwise helpful.

For launch projects and future portfolio pieces we recommend that you take a look at the [Code Your Future Starter Kit](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-final-project-starter-kit). This assessment project is a simplified version of the starter kit, with a lot of the features removed to keep it light and more understandable. In fact, some of the challenges that we ask you is to re-add these features yourself, like support for linting.

Since these features will already be present in the starter kit, hence it will be a much better starting point for you to work with. And since it uses the same libraries and setup that you will learn here, we believe you will feel immediately familiar with it as well.
