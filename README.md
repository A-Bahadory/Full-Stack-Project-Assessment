# Video Recommendation App

## Background

Before you continue to final projects we have to make sure that you can meaningfully contribute to a technical project.

This means that we need to be sure that you can create and deploy Full Stack application.

## Challenge

In this project, you will be building up a small project that allows you to share your favourite Youtube videos with the world. We will be starting up with a very small MVP (Minimal Viable Product), and built on top of it to make it nicer and more useful.

## Requirements

The project requirements are split into several levels that you should complete during each week of this project.

All the requirements for this project are captured as issues that you can find on this planning board: https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/projects/169

**Note:** Some of the issues are optional which means that you can build a working project without them. However, to make something really impressive you will need to complete as much as you can.

### Week 1 - Minimal Viable Product

### Week 2 - Additional features

### Week 3 - Finalizing project

### Week 4 - Stretch goals

- Use this week as an extra time to implement missing required and optional features from previous weeks.

**Note:** You can design the website to look however you like.

## Using this project for the launch project and other portfolio pieces

While you are free to use this codebase for your future projects we recommend against it. This project is set up in a way to make it easy to understand, but lacks a lot of features that would be otherwise helpful.

For launch projects and future portfolio pieces we recommend that you take a look at the [Code Your Future Starter Kit](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/cyf-final-project-starter-kit). This assessment project is a simplified version of the starter kit, with a lot of the features removed to keep it light and more understandable. In fact, some of the challenges that we ask you is to re-add these features yourself, like support for linting.

Since these features will already be present in the starter kit, hence it will be a much better starting point for you to work with. And since it uses the same libraries and setup that you will learn here, we believe you will feel immediately familiar with it as well.
