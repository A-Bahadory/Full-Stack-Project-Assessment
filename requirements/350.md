# Level 350 - Week 3 - Final checks

Make sure to verify that all of the features work and they are deployed to the internet.

## Core Feature Acceptance Criteria

### Video Recommendations app

- [ ] The website displays a clear list of video recommendations.
- [ ] Each recommendation includes an embedded YouTube video playable directly on the site.

### Accessibility

- [ ] A Lighthouse accessibility audit is conducted and achieves above 80 on Accessibility.
- [ ] The Lighthouse report (HTML) is included in the Pull Request.
- [ ] The `<iframe>` for embedded videos includes a descriptive `title` attribute representing the video's content.
- [ ] CSS provides clear focus states to visually indicate the currently active control.
- [ ] All website controls can be navigated and activated using only the keyboard.

### Adding Videos

- [ ] Implements a `POST /videos` backend endpoint to facilitate adding videos to the API.
- [ ] Generates and attaches a unique ID to each newly added video.
- [ ] Accepts video data in JSON format (example provided).
- [ ] Returns the generated ID in a JSON response (example provided).

### Deleting Videos

- [ ] Implement a `DELETE /videos/{id}` backend endpoint to remove specific videos.
- [ ] Handle non- [ ]existent video IDs gracefully, returning an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `404`).
- [ ] Optionally, provide a confirmation message or use HTTP status code `204` to indicate successful deletion.
- [ ] A delete button within video component allows users to delete videos
- [ ] This button should call the `DELETE /videos/{id}` API endpoint to remove the corresponding video.

### Update ratings

- [ ] Each video displays its current rating in a visually clear manner (e.g., thumbs up /thumbs down icons, numeric display).
- [ ] Users can increase the rating of a video ("thumbs up").
- [ ] Users can decrease the rating of a video ("thumbs down").
- [ ] A user's rating actions are recorded and persist across sessions.

**Usability**

- [ ] The rating controls are easily discoverable and intuitive to use.
- [ ] Visual feedback (e.g., icon changes, updated counts) confirms a user's rating actions.

## Deployment Verification ðŸš€

- [ ] **Confirm live deployment:** Ensure that all features function correctly on the deployed version of your website (e.g., Netlify).

## Graduation Project Readiness

- [ ] **Seek Tech-Ed Review:** Request a Tech-Ed volunteer to assess your implementation and confirm it meets all requirements. Their approval is necessary for joining the graduation project.

## Optional Enhancements

#### Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Display Changes: Consider whether ratings should immediately update the displayed value or require a page refresh to see changes.
- [ ] Prevent Multiple Votes: Explore options to limit users to a single vote (up or down) per video.
- [ ] **Explore Missed Levels:** If time permits, review any optional levels you may have skipped.
- [ ] **Portfolio Prep:** Prioritize level 399 ([./399.md]) if you intend to showcase this project.
- [ ] **Further Exploration:** Consider implementing additional ideas from level 499 ([./499.md]).

If you have confirmed all of the features above are working then congratulations! You have deployed this Full Stack Project to the internet! Make sure to ask a tech-ed volunteer to go through your implementation and verify that it works as expected. Once they do that, you will be approved to join the graduation project!

If you have time you should still check any optional levels that you have missed so far. If you wish this to be one of your portfolio piece we strongly recommend checking [level 399](./399.md) first. Afterwards if you still have some time you can find some additional ideas at [level 499](./499.md) that we recommend you taking a look at!
