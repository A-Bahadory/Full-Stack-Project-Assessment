# Level 350 - Week 3 - Final checks

Make sure to check that all of the features work and they are deployed to the internet.

## Core Feature Acceptance Criteria

### Video Recommendations app

- [ ] On page load, the website should display a list of video recommendations
- [ ] For each video recommendation:
  - It should show the video's title
  - If you click on the title it it should redirect you to the YouTube page for that video

### Accessibility

- [ ] A Lighthouse accessibility audit is conducted and achieves above 80 on Accessibility.
- [ ] The Lighthouse report (HTML) is included in the Pull Request.
- [ ] The `<iframe>` for embedded videos includes a descriptive `title` attribute representing the video's content.
- [ ] CSS provides clear focus states to visually indicate the currently active control.
- [ ] All website controls can be navigated and activated using only the keyboard.

### Adding Videos

- [ ] There is a `POST /videos` backend endpoint to facilitate adding videos to the database.
- [ ] The endpoint generates and attaches a unique ID to each newly added video.
- [ ] The endpoint accepts video data in JSON format (example provided).
- [ ] The endpoint responds with a JSON response that includes the generated id (example provided)
- [ ] Given a new video form, When a user inputs their new video, they can add a new video recommendation
- [ ] Any posted videos are persisted in the database

#### Backend validation

- [ ] The endpoint ensures submitted titles are not empty.
- [ ] The endpoint validates provided URLs as legitimate YouTube URLs.
- [ ] The endpoint returns an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `400` or `422`) for invalid input.

### Deleting Videos

- [ ] A `DELETE /videos/{id}` backend endpoint is implemented to remove specific videos.
- [ ] The endpoint handles non-existent video IDs gracefully, returning an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `404`).
- [ ] The endpoint returns a confirmation message or uses an HTTP status code `204` to indicate successful deletion.
- [ ] Given a video recommendation, When the user clicks on a delete button, It removes the video recommendation
- [ ] Any video deletions are persisted in the database

### Update ratings

- [ ] Each video displays its current rating in a visually clear manner (e.g., thumbs up /thumbs down icons, numeric display).
- [ ] Users can increase the rating of a video ("thumbs up").
- [ ] Users can decrease the rating of a video ("thumbs down").
- [ ] A user's rating actions are recorded and persist across sessions.

### Usability

- [ ] The rating controls are easily discoverable and intuitive to use.
- [ ] Visual feedback (e.g., icon changes, updated counts) confirms a user's rating actions.

## Deployment Verification ðŸš€

- [ ] **Confirm live deployment:** Ensure that all features function correctly on the deployed version of your website (e.g. Netlify).

## Graduation Project Readiness

- [ ] **Seek Tech-Ed Review:** Request a Tech-Ed volunteer to assess your implementation and confirm it meets all requirements. Their approval is necessary for joining the graduation project.

## Optional Enhancements

#### Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Display Changes: Consider whether ratings should immediately update the displayed value or require a page refresh to see changes.
- [ ] Prevent Multiple Votes: Explore options to limit users to a single vote (up or down) per video.
- [ ] **Explore Missed Levels:** If time permits, review any optional levels you may have skipped.
- [ ] **Portfolio Prep:** Prioritize level 399 ([./399.md]) if you intend to showcase this project.
- [ ] **Further Exploration:** Consider implementing additional ideas from level 499 ([./499.md]).

If you have confirmed all of the features above are working then congratulations! You have deployed this Full Stack Project to the internet! Make sure to ask a tech-ed volunteer to go through your implementation and verify that it works as expected. Once they do that, you will be approved to join the graduation project!

If you have time you should still check any optional levels that you have missed so far. If you wish this to be one of your portfolio piece we strongly recommend checking [level 399](./399.md) first. Afterwards if you still have some time you can find some additional ideas at [level 499](./499.md) that we recommend you taking a look at!
