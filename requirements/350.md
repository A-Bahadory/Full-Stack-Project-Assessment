# Level 350 - Week 3 - Final checks

Make sure to verify that all of the features work and they are deployed to the internet.

## Core Feature Acceptance Criteria

### Video Recommendations

- The website displays a clear list of video recommendations.
- Each recommendation includes an embedded YouTube video playable directly on the site.

### Adding Videos

- A dedicated section exists for adding new videos to the website.
- The API enforces validation:
  - Videos cannot be submitted without titles.
  - Submitted URLs must be valid YouTube URLs.

### Deleting Videos

- Each video has a functional "Delete" button.
- Clicking the "Delete" button successfully removes the corresponding video.

### Rating Videos

- Each video has "Vote Up" and "Vote Down" buttons.
- Clicking these buttons respectively increases or decreases the video's rating.
- Rating changes are saved to the database and persist across sessions.

## Deployment Verification

- **Confirm live deployment:** Ensure that all features function correctly on the deployed version of your website (e.g., Netlify).

## Graduation Project Readiness

- **Seek Tech-Ed Review:** Request a Tech-Ed volunteer to assess your implementation and confirm it meets all requirements. Their approval is necessary for joining the graduation project.

## Optional Enhancements

- **Explore Missed Levels:** If time permits, review any optional levels you may have skipped.
- **Portfolio Prep:** Prioritize level 399 ([./399.md]) if you intend to showcase this project.
- **Further Exploration:** Consider implementing additional ideas from level 499 ([./499.md]).

If you have confirmed all of the features above are working then congratulations! You have deployed this Full Stack Project to the internet! Make sure to ask a tech-ed volunteer to go through your implementation and verify that it works as expected. Once they do that, you will be approved to join the graduation project!

If you have time you should still check any optional levels that you have missed so far. If you wish this to be one of your portfolio piece we strongly recommend checking [level 399](./399.md) first. Afterwards if you still have some time you can find some additional ideas at [level 499](./499.md) that we recommend you taking a look at!
