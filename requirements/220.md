# Level 220 - Week 2 - Deleting Videos üóëÔ∏è

With your new feature in place you are now starting to add a lot of videos. You soon realize your recommendations start to grow huge, and some of the videos you don't really want to recommend anymore. This is a good time to implement a new feature to allow them to be deleted!

## New Endpoint (`DELETE /videos/{id}`)

This endpoint is used to delete a specific video from the database. `DELETE` endpoints don't require a request body, and they don't even need to return a response body! While you can return a confirmation message: however, if you don't want to, you can use the HTTP status code `204` to tell the client that the action was successful, but there is no response body.

To make the endpoint nicer, you can also change it so if you try to call this endpoint on an `id` that doesn't exist, the system may respond with a HTTP `404` status code designating that the video did not exist in the first place or was already deleted.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Implement a `DELETE /videos/{id}` backend endpoint to remove specific videos.
- Handle non-existent video IDs gracefully, returning an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `404`).
- Optionally, provide a confirmation message or use HTTP status code `204` to indicate successful deletion.

## New Component

### Acceptance Criteria

- Create a button within video components to trigger the video deletion process.
- This button should call the `DELETE /videos/{id}` API endpoint to remove the corresponding video.

## Deployment

### Acceptance Criteria

- Deploy the changes to Netlify and ensure the delete functionality is accessible for testing.

## User Testing

### Acceptance Criteria

- Collaborate with classmates to test each other's applications, providing and receiving feedback.
