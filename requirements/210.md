# Level 210 - Week 2 - Adding new videos ðŸ“¹

Your website is getting better and better every day. You feel good and decide to watch some tutorial videos on YouTube. One of them catches your eye and decide to add it to your video recommendations. However you realize, that currently the only way to add new items is to edit the database. That's not too convenient, so you set up to change this!

## New endpoint

Any action that changes the database needs to be implemented on the backend. This means implementing a new endpoint!

### `POST` "/videos"

This endpoint is used to add a video to the API.

**Note:** When a video is added, you must attach a unique ID to it so that it can later be deleted

#### Example input

```json
{
	"title": "The Title",
	"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABCDEFGHIJK"
}
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
	"id": 523523
}
```

**Note:** You don't need to adhere to the examples above. In fact if you started working on the level 199 feature "Proper error handling" you will likely going to use a different response.

## Build out the frontend

Now that you have the endpoint created you need to add a new React component to your website that allows you to add new videos.

## Data validation

## Deployment

Once you finish with your changes, and merge your code, make sure it is accessible on Netlify as well, so you can show it to your friends!
