# Level 130 - Week 1 - Frontend

Level 130 will finalize our MVP by creating the frontend part, making sure that you have a simple page that displays the videos from your database.

## Project setup

Since we are using a monorepo, you can launch the frontend the same way you launch the backend. Run the following command in the root of your repo:

```sh
npm run dev
```

The code you put under `client/src` will then be accessible on http://localhost:3000

## Implementing your frontend

### Acceptance criteria

- Have a React component that displays a video recommendation
- It should show the video's title
- If you click on the title it it should redirect you to the YouTube page for that video
- Have another React component that acts as a container for the above component
- Make sure that on page load the list of videos is loaded from the API and displayed using the components above

## API access from React

Since we are using a monorepo, the API is accessible on the same base domain as the frontend. This means you can use calls like `fetch("/api/videos")` and it will call the endpoint you created in your backend. You don't need to worry about CORS requirements either.

Checkout this cheat sheet to help you with the types of requests you'll need to be using with `fetch`: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/fetch-api-cheatsheet/

## Styling

While you are free to do styling on the result, as this is only an MVP you shouldn't spend too much time making the website look nice.

## Deployment

If you have set up Netlify deployment in [level 120](./120.md) this should now work automatically for the frontend as well. Make sure to test it out though. Once you have the url to your deployed frontend, add it to the **About** section on your Github repo ![about settings for github repo](about-githubrepo.png). Paste the URL to your deployed frontend into the website section.
